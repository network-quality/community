## Welcome

You can't spell `network-quality` without `u` -- that's why *everyone* is welcome to help us build protocols and tools dedicated to increasing consumer's awareness about the quality of their network connections. 

Our work (right now) is happening in 

- [draft-ietf-ippm-responsiveness](http://www.github.com/network-quality/draft-ietf-ippm-responsiveness): The IETF draft specification for the "RPM" protocol
- [server](http://www.github.com/network-quality/server): Several implementations of web servers capable of being the target of RPM clients.
- [goresponsiveness](http://www.github.com/network-quality/goresponsiveness): An open-source RPM client (written in Go).

Our community is coordinated according to the documentation in this repository's wiki: [Wiki](https://github.com/network-quality/community/wiki)
